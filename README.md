SearchEngine
============

A search engine which is quite similar to the basic initial search engine done by google. 
The programs are quite jumbled and it unfortunately wont work unless i give it the large 
amount of data which is needed for searching and infromation retrieval.

But nonetheless. It does have all the programs which depict the different concepts used in the project such as TF/IDF, Authorities, Hubs, Page Ranking, Similairty pages and Clustering.
